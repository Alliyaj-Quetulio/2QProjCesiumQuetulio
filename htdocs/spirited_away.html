				<div class="summary">
					<p> As Chihiro and her parents make their way to their new home, they stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park. After the sun sets, Chihiro's mother and father are turned into giant pigs and supernatural beings start to fill up the park. Chihiro comes to meet a mysterious boy, who safely leads her to a busy bathhouse, explaining that she must work in order to protect and free herself and her parents. The boy says that his name is Haku, and that he has known her since she was very small, he then abruptly leaves. </p>
					<p> After meeting two employees of a bathhouse—Kamaji, a boiler operator, and Lin, a yuna worker—Chihiro manages to  signs a job contract with Yubaba, the sorceress who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba takes a few characters from Chihiro's name and renames her as Sen. Haku warns her not to forget her real name, as it is needed for her to get back home. He then says that he no longer remembers his own real name. After their conversation, Chihiro looks at the sky and sees a flying white dragon; she knows that the dragon is Haku. </p>
					<p> On Chihiro’s first day of work at the bathhouse, she lets a mysterious masked spirit called in No-Face, who becomes obsessed with getting her attention. She also cleans a stink spirit, which turns out to be a polluted river spirit. This river spirit gives her a magic herbal ball to show his gratitude. </p>
					<p> The next morning, Chihiro encounters a heavily injured Haku being chased by magical paper birds while in his dragon form. He finds refuge in Yubaba's office. Knowing he’ll bleed to death without help, Chihiro runs to find him; but unbeknownst to her, one of the magical paper birds hides behind her back. Meanwhile, No-Face is causing an uproar by creating gold out of thin air. He is praised and given all sorts of gifts by the eager employees of the bathhouse. As Chihiro makes her way to Yubaba's office, No-Face offers her a pile of gold. When she rejects this offer, No-Face runs wild and starts eating the crowd around him. </p>
					<p> Arriving at Yubaba's office, Chihiro finds Haku unconscious. The magical paper bird that followed her is revealed to be Yubaba's twin sister, Zeniba. Zeniba explains that she followed Haku because he stole her gold seal. Thrashing around, Haku smashes the paper bird, and Zeniba disappears. Haku and Chihiro fall down a dark shaft into the boiler room. In an attempt to help Haku, Chihiro gives him part of the magic herbal ball the river spirit gave her. Haku spits out Zeniba's gold seal and a black slug, which Chihiro squashes. To help fully cure Haku, Chihiro decides to take the train to Zeniba's house in order to ask for her forgiveness. </p>
					<p> On the way to the train station, Chihiro confronts and feeds No-Face what remains of her magic herbal ball. This causes No-Face to vomit out everything they've eaten, including the employees of the bathhouse. After calming down, Chihiro and No-Face board the train. </p>
					<p> When they arrive at Zeniba's house, Chihiro apologizes for Haku's actions and for squashing the black slug. Zeniba clarifies that the slug is not her spell, but Yubaba's. She used the slug to control Haku, and by squashing it, Chihiro has freed Haku. Haku awakens and strikes a deal with Yubaba, asking her to send Chihiro and her parents back to their world. He then travels to Zeniba's house to pick up Chihiro. As they both head back to the bathhouse, Chihiro remembers falling into a river as a child, but instead of drowning, the river carried her to safety. She tells Haku that the name of the river is Kohaku River, and that she believes that river is him. Due to this, Haku remembers his real name, Nigihayami Kohakunushi. </p>
					<p> Once they arrive at the bathhouse, Chihiro is presented with a challenge that she has to complete before Yubaba sends Chihiro and her parents back home. Chihiro must identify her parents out of a drove of pigs. After correctly pointing out that none of the pigs are her parents, her contract dissolves and she is free to go. She says her goodbyes to Haku, both stating that they will meet again. She finds her parents right outside the amusement park, and with all three of them together, they drive away, continuing where they left off before. </p>

				<h1> Personal Commentary </h1>
			</header>
			<p> The writing and animation of Spirited Away is truly impactful, remarkable, and memorable. Following the story was enjoyable and effortless, and I loved the elements of mystery sprinkled throughout the story. </p>
			<p> The animation and art style used in this movie never fails to leave me awestruck. It is no mystery that Studio Ghibli is known for its top-tier animation, visual effects and character design, and this movie was no different. </p>
