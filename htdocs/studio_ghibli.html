					<h1> Miyazaki Hayao </h1>
					<p class = "text"> He is a Japanese animator, director, producer, screenwriter, author, and manga artist. He is widely respected and regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation. During the early years of his career, he was employed in multiple animation studios such as Toei Animation, Shin-Ei Animation, and Nippon Animation. Around the same time, he started to collaborate with a future co-founder of Studio Ghibli, Takahata Isao. From there, he slowly climbed the ranks until finally founding Studio Ghibli in 1985. </p>
					<hr>
					<h1> Takahata Isao </h1>
					<p class = "text"> He was a Japanese director, screenwriter and producer who has earned international acclaim for his work as a director of Japanese animated feature films. He worked and held various positions over the years and collaborated with fellow colleague, Miyazaki Hayao. Eventually, he got to direct his own film, “The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun” which was released in 1969. He continued his partnership with Miyazaki and eventually founded Studio Ghibli alongside him. “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya” was the last film he directed before passing away on 5 April 2018. </p>
					<hr>
					<h1> Suzuki Toshio </h1>
					<p class = "text"> He is a film producer of anime and a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki. Due to the enormous box office success of many Ghibli films, Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most successful producers. Early in his career, he was employed in a couple of publishing companies where he worked as an editor for magazines. Thanks to his line of work, he was able to meet cartoonists, directors, and artists. Among them were Miyazaki Hayao and Takahata Isao. The three eventually began a collaborative relationship. He founded Studio Ghibli alongside them, where he was appointed the company’s corporation president. He stepped down from the position in 2008, taking a managing director position instead. Then in March 2014, Suzuki retired as a producer. </p>

					<h1 > Studio Ghibli, why was it founded? </h1>
				</header>
				<div class = "text">
					<p> Prior to its foundation on June 15, 1985, Miyazaki and Takahata already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had collaborated on feature films several times before. They’ve also established a collaborative relationship with Suzuki, an editor and producer. </p>
					<p> After the success of the 1984 film “Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind”—which was written and directed by Miyazaki, and Suzuki was part of the production team—Miyazaki and Suzuki decided to found Studio Ghibli, inviting Takahata to join them. And thus, the collective passion of these three individuals for film and animation is how Studio Ghibli ended being one of the most successful animation studios of all time. </p>
